![title](.pics/readme.jpg)
This is a school project *(scrum)* that is organized with Azure DevOps. It's a UCOS3 project.

**Key Functionality**
- Different functionalities run in separate RTOS tasks

- MODBUS slave and master modules
- Sensor reading with slave modules
- Showing readings on master module
- Push button functionality to show different readings


Fork of Velho's stm32-demo project.
My part is to add LCD functionality to the project.
Current working branch is dev-uc3.

GPIO pinouts configurations are autogenerated by CubeIDE and are in
- [Core/Src/gpio.c](Core/Src/gpio.c)
- [Core/Inc/main.h](Core/Inc/main.h)

Pin mapping for the driver is found in
- [Core/Lib/BSP/lcd16x2/LCD16x2_cfg.c](Core/Lib/BSP/lcd16x2/LCD16x2_cfg.c)

Big thanks to the deepbluembedded.com for the driver example!
It was easy to understand with config files and separate delay function
that was easy to modify to our needs.

My code LCD code can mainly be found in

- [Core/Inc/lcd_display.h](Core/Inc/lcd_display.h)
- [Core/Src/lcd_display.c](Core/Src/lcd_display.c)

It was also my responsibility to make UCOS3 task to update the lcd screen.
